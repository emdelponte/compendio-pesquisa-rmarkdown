  abstract  = "For various reasons, it is important, if not essential, to
               integrate the computations and code used in data analyses,
               methodological descriptions, simulations, etc. with the
               documents that describe and rely on them. This integration
               allows readers to both verify and adapt the statements in the
               documents. Authors can easily reproduce them in the future, and
               they can present the document's contents in a different medium,
               e.g. with interactive controls. This paper describes a software
               framework for authoring and distributing these integrated,
               dynamic documents that contain text, code, data, and any
               auxiliary content needed to recreate the computations. The
               documents are dynamic in that the contents, including figures,
               tables, etc., can be recalculated each time a view of the
               document is generated. Our model treats a dynamic document as a
               master or ``source'' document from which one can generate
               different views in the form of traditional, derived documents
               for different audiences. We introduce the concept of a
               compendium as both a container for the different elements that
               make up the document and its computations (i.e. text, code,
               data, ...), and as a means for distributing, managing and
               updating the collection. The step from disseminating analyses
               via a compendium to reproducible research is a small one. By
               reproducible research, we mean research papers with accompanying
               software tools that allow the reader to directly reproduce the
               results and employ the methods that are presented in the
               research paper. Some of the issues involved in paradigms for the
               production, distribution and use of such reproducible research
               are discussed.",
